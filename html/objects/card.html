            <p>This card gives access to the chemical laboratory. There are three main objectives of water chemistry control in nuclear power plants:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Materials integrity—prevent degradation of the metals in the reactor pressure vessel, piping, steam generator, and other key components</li>
                <li>Fuel reliability—optimize fuel performance and protect the fuel cladding</li>
                <li>Worker safety—reduce radiation fields outside the reactor core</li>
            </ul>
		    <p>Water chemistry programs measure dozens of parameters and chemical constituents that interact with each other and with plant materials. For example, plant chemists are concerned about the levels of anions (such as chloride and sulfate) that can lead to cracking of major components. Radioisotopes are tracked because they can indicate problems such as a leak in the fuel cladding. Corrosion products can impact heat transfer efficiency and, when activated, can expose workers to radiation. Additives are also monitored and controlled. These include boron (which impacts the core’s reactivity), zinc (which can reduce corrosion products and radiation fields), and amines and alkalis (which help manage pH).</p>
