            <p>Borates play a key role in the operation of nuclear power plants, and they are essential in the safety and control of pressurized water reactors (PWRs) and boiling water reactors. The 10B isotope, present at around 20% natural abundance, has a very high nuclear cross section and can capture the thermal neutrons that result from the fission reaction of uranium nuclear fuel. This radiation-absorbing effect is used in the shielding, control, and safety of nuclear reactors and in medical therapeutics.</p>
            <p>By dissolving high-purity boric acid in the primary cooling circuit of PWRs, operators can adjust the quantity of 10B in the reaction environment—and thus control the rate of a nuclear reaction and the energy that it generates. In some scenarios, borates can also be used in the secondary circuit as a corrosion inhibitor.</p>
            <p>Nuclear control rods can be made of boron carbide, an extremely hard ceramic. Borates can be used in the cooling water in fuel storage pools. And borates serve as a key safety feature of emergency core-cooling systems, where they are injected into the core from the tank. Consistent boron levels maintain a consistent energy output; out-of-control reactions can be quenched with boric acid, which absorbs neutrons. Sodium borates are also used as corrosion inhibitors.</p>
