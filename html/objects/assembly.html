		    <p>Most of PWRs use the uranium fuel, which is in the form of uranium dioxide. The UO2 is pressed into pellets, these pellets are then sintered into the solid. These pellets are then loaded and encapsulated within a fuel rod (or fuel pin), which is made of zirkonium alloys. The fuel rods and the pellets constitute the first barrier, which retains radioactive material within the fuel and protect the environment.</p>
            <p>The collection of fuel rods or elements is called the fuel assembly. The fuel assembly constitute the base element of the nuclear reactor core. The reactor core (PWR type) contains about 157 fuel assemblies (depending on a reactor type). Western PWRs use a square lattice arrangement and assemblies are characterized by the number of rods they contain, typically, 17×17 in current designs. Russian VVER-type reactors use a fuel that is characterized by their hexagonal arrangement, but is otherwise of similar length and structure to other PWR fuel assemblies.</p>
            <p>A PWR fuel assemblies stand between four and five metres high, are about 20 cm across and weighs about half a tonne. The assemblies have vacant rod positions for control rods or in-core instrumentation.</p>
